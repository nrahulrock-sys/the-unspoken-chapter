  body: `I don’t know how to begin this without sounding like I’m holding on, so I’ll start with honesty instead.

Thank you.

For the moments that didn’t need words. For the days that felt lighter just because you were there. For being a part of my life in a way that changed me for the better.

What we shared was real — at least to me — and I don’t want to reduce it to memories that fade quietly. Some things deserve to be acknowledged, even when they end.

I won’t pretend I didn’t wish for more time. But I’ve learned that care doesn’t always mean staying — sometimes it means letting go without turning love into a burden.

Wherever life takes you from here, I hope you find peace, excitement, laughter, and someone who understands you in all the ways you deserve.

As for me, I’ll carry what was good, learn from what wasn’t, and be grateful for what existed — even briefly.

This is not a goodbye filled with regret. It’s one filled with respect.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for the memories.

I wish you a beautiful year ahead — and a beautiful life beyond this moment.`,
